# Hey, I'm Cole Sweeney 

I'm a recent Informatics graduate from Indiana University with a focus on data science, public health, and emerging tech. I like building tools that help people make better decisions—especially when they involve messy real-world data, sustainability, or accessibility.

*Indiana University — May 2024*

## 💻 Projects

### 🍽️ Plate Saver – Food Waste Reduction App  
Collaborated with a student team to design and build a full-stack web app aimed at reducing food waste on campus. Users could log and track leftover meals, get meal planning suggestions, and measure food saved over time. Built using Python, Flask, SQL, Google Api, and HTML/CSS. Served as a capstone project for the Informatics degree at Indiana University.

### 💉 COVID-19 Vaccination Rate Dashboard  
Created an interactive dashboard using Python (Pandas, Plotly, Dash) to track COVID-19 vaccination rates across U.S. states. Pulled data from public APIs (CDC and/or Our World in Data) and visualized trends over time. Designed to be simple, responsive, and easy to understand for non-technical users, including public health outreach teams.

### 🌍 Environmental Health Dashboard  
Used Python (Pandas, Plotly, Dash) to visualize PM2.5 air quality data from the OpenAQ API. Created dynamic visualizations and trend tracking across U.S. cities. Used by peers for public health research and environmental policy projects.

### 🧠 EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees *(In Progress)*  
Built interpretable models in Python using scikit-learn to analyze EEG frequency band patterns and cognitive states. Focused on decision tree modeling for explainability. Shared as part of a research collaboration.

### 🌡️ Sensor Simulation Script *(In Progress)*  
Developing a Python-based tool to simulate thermocouple and voltage readings. Used for testing data pipelines, validating refresh intervals, and measuring system performance under load. Incorporates realistic signal variation and modular config.

### ⌨️ Brain-Inspired UI Navigation *(In Progress)*  
Creating a Python program that uses keyboard emulation (`pynput`) to simulate user input through simplified binary triggers. Designed to explore accessible input systems inspired by brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for motor-impaired users.

## 📌 Goals  
- Build and document more public-facing projects  
- Contribute to a clean tech or AI-for-good org  
- Learn just enough backend dev to be dangerous
