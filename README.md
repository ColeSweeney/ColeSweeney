# Hey, I'm Cole Sweeney 

I'm a recent Informatics graduate from Indiana University with a focus on data science, public health, and emerging tech. I like building tools that help people make better decisions—especially when they involve messy real-world data, sustainability, or accessibility.

## 🛠 Technical Skills
- **Languages:** Python, SQL, R, PHP, MATLAB, HTML, CSS
- **Tools:** Power BI, Git, Jupyter, Excel, VS Code
- **Learning:** Docker, FastAPI, Streamlit, LLMs, CI/CD

## 🎓 Education
**B.S., Informatics**

*Minor in Public Health*

*Indiana University — May 2024*

## 💻 Projects

### 🧠 Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees  
Used scikit-learn to build interpretable models for analyzing EEG band patterns in cognitive state research. [Publication](#)  

### 🌡️ Sensor Simulation Script *(in progress)*  
Simulates thermocouple and voltage readings to test data pipeline performance. Focused on clean code, realistic randomness, and modular testing.  

### ⌨️ Brain-Inspired UI Navigation *(in progress)*  
Python-based keyboard emulation prototype that explores simplified input mapping for motor-impaired users.  

## 📌 Goals  
- Build and document more public-facing projects  
- Contribute to a clean tech or AI-for-good org  
- Learn just enough backend dev to be dangerous
